# Adaptive Protein Design and Optimization (APDO)

APDO is a revolutionary protein computational engineering framework that
integrates machine learning, molecular dynamics principles, and
quantum-mechanics–inspired energy scoring to design and optimize protein
structures.

## Core Concepts
- Quantum mechanics–based scoring function (electrostatics, van der Waals, solvation)
- Adaptive optimization of protein conformations
- Machine learning–assisted property prediction (extensible)

## Current Status
- Executable MVP
- Coarse-grained protein representation
- Physics-informed energy minimization
